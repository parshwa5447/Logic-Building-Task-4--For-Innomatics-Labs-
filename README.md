# 📘 Python Real-World Mini Systems Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of real-world Python mini systems developed to demonstrate practical programming concepts using functions, loops, conditionals, and data structures.

Each problem simulates an industry-based scenario such as telecom recharge validation, warehouse stock alerts, result processing, fare calculation, attendance eligibility, and password security validation.

The goal of this project is to build strong logical thinking and real-world implementation skills using core Python.
